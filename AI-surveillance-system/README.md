- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns across multiple files
- **Event-Driven**: Logging system tracks all activities
- **Configurable**: Settings managed through config.env
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new detection methods

### üîç **Core Features**
1. **Motion Detection**: Uses MOG2 background subtraction to detect movement
2. **Face Recognition**: Identifies known vs unknown faces using face_recognition library
3. **ROI Monitoring**: Can focus on specific areas of interest
4. **Alert System**: Triggers alerts and saves frames when threats detected
5. **Persistent Storage**: Saves face encodings and detection frames

### üìÅ **File Structure Explained**
- `surveillance.py` - Main orchestrator that combines all components
- `face_detection.py` - Handles face detection/recognition pipeline
- `motion_detection.py` - Background subtraction motion detection
- `register_face.py` - Tool to add new faces to known database
- `logger.py` - Event logging system
- `utils.py` - Helper functions for file handling, coordinates, etc.
- `config.env` - Configuration settings

### üöÄ **To Get It Working in Colab:**

1. **Copy the complete code** from the first artifact into a Colab cell
2. **Install dependencies** using the setup instructions
3. **Test with image upload** using `demo_image_processing()`
4. **Setup LFW dataset** for face recognition testing
5. **Check logs** to see detection results

The system maintains your original modular architecture while being Colab-compatible. It will detect motion, recognize faces, log events, and save detection frames automatically.
